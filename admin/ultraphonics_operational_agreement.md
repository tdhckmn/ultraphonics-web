Ultraphonics
Operational Agreement & Rate Structure
(NON-CLIENT FACING) (This document is a work in progress)



Effective Date: January 15, 2026
Document Type: Internal Operations & Compensation Framework (Non-Client Facing)

This agreement establishes the operational structure, member roles, compensation framework, and pricing guidelines for Ultraphonics.


1. BAND STRUCTURE & MEMBER ROLES
1.1 Core Members
The band consists of the following core members:
• Anthony – Drums, Owner, Band Leader, Event Handler, Technical Operations
• Tom – Guitar
• Lester – Bass
1.2 Vocalist Roles
Founding Vocalists
David and Shelley are founding vocalists with guaranteed roster positions for all performances where they are available, regardless of gig size or compensation level.
Progressive Roster Vocalist
Kelsey operates under a progressive roster model based on gig tier:
• Premium Gigs ($1,000+ musician base): Full roster member with guaranteed position
• Standard Gigs (Under $1,000 musician base): Fill-in capacity, available when founding vocalists are unavailable or when all members mutually agree to expand the lineup

This structure allows Kelsey to build toward full membership as the band secures higher-paying engagements while maintaining sustainable compensation for all members during the growth phase.



2. PERFORMANCE LINEUP CONFIGURATIONS
2.1 Standard Lineup by Gig Tier

Premium Gigs ($1,000+ musician base)
• 6 members: Anthony, Tom, Lester, David, Shelley, Kelsey

Standard Gigs (Under $1,000 musician base)
• 4 members: Anthony, Tom, Lester + 1 vocalist (typically David or Shelley)
• 5 members: Anthony, Tom, Lester + 2 vocalists (typically David and Shelley)
• 6 members: All members may perform if unanimously agreed upon

2.2 Availability and Flexibility
• All vocalists may opt in or opt out of performances based on personal availability
• When a founding vocalist is unavailable for standard gigs, Kelsey has priority for that position
• No member is required to perform at every gig
• Lineup decisions for each performance will be confirmed at least 2 weeks in advance when possible

2.3 Song Assignments
Songs will be assigned with primary (A), secondary (B), and tertiary (C) lead vocalists to ensure cross-compatibility and seamless coverage when members are unavailable.





3. CORE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY
3.1 Performance-Based Model
Musicians are compensated based on contracted performance blocks, not hourly labor. Compensation is distributed evenly among all performing members for both base performance fees and additional paid services.

3.2 Guaranteed Performance Minimums
Per Band Member:
• 3-hour performance: $150 minimum
• 4-hour performance: $160 minimum

These minimums are derived from a $50/hour baseline and apply regardless of set configuration, break placement, timeline adjustments, or unforeseen circumstances during the event.

3.3 Internal Performance Pools
Three-Hour Engagement:
• 5-piece band: $750 musician base 
• 6-piece band: $1,000 musician base 
Four-Hour Engagement:
• 5-piece band: $800 musician base
• 6-piece band: $1,000 musician base

Note: When quoting clients, these musician bases plus early arrival premium (if applicable) form the foundation of the total quote, along with any add-on services.


3.4 Payment Distribution Formula
All performance compensation and add-on revenue is distributed evenly among performing band members:

5-Member Configuration:
• Each member receives equal 20% share

6-Member Configuration:
• Each member receives equal 16.67% share

3.5 Compensation Examples
Musician Base    	5 Members       	6 Members
$750             		$150/person     	N/A
$900             		$180/person     	N/A
$1,000           		$200/person     	$167/person
$1,200           		$240/person     	$200/person
$1,500           		$300/person     	$250/person
$2,000           		$400/person     	$333/person

3.6 Third-Party Personnel
Additional musicians, sound engineers, or lighting personnel are contracted at an agreed internal rate and included in the client's base quote to avoid negative financial impact to core band members.

3.7 Equipment Investment Recognition
Contributing members acknowledge their ongoing equipment investments and shared operational costs. These contributions are recognized but do not alter the equal per-performance compensation model. As the band secures higher-paying gigs, increased compensation naturally provides better return on these investments. Equipment is strictly tracked ensuring all contributors are noted.





4. EARLY ARRIVAL & PRODUCTION PREMIUM
4.1 Trigger Conditions
• Arrival before 5:00 PM, or
• Early venue access requiring pre-production setup

4.2 Production Premium Amount
$300 flat production premium added to the client quote

4.3 Allocation Rules

Priority Allocation:
1. Event handler/production lead (must be included)
2. Additional early-arrival labor participants (up to 2 more, depending on event scope)
3. Up to $50/hour per individual for 1–3 participating individuals total

Remaining Buffer:
Any remaining early arrival and production buffer (after compensating early-arrival participants) is distributed evenly among all performing band members, unless otherwise allocated by internal agreement.

9.1 Primary Responsibilities

• Background vocals and harmonies on other songs
• Active participation in rehearsals and setlist development

9.2 Performance Support Duties
When not actively singing, vocalists contribute to production quality through:
• Additional instrumentation: Vocalists are encouraged to play an additional instrument on desired songs, but are not expected to perform additional instruments on any song. E.g. Tambourine, guitar, keyboards
• Sound monitoring: Checking front-of-house sound from audience perspective
• Media capture: Photography and video documentation for promotional purposes
• Technical support: Operating X Air tablet for sound adjustments (with training)
• Live streaming: Managing streaming equipment when applicable

These responsibilities eliminate the need for external sound engineers or photographers at most performances and strengthen the band's self-sufficient operational model.





10. EVENT HANDLER AUTHORITY & CONTROL
10.1 Event Handler Role
The event handler (typically Anthony) serves as the production lead and primary point of contact during performances.

10.2 Authority Includes
• Managing timeline changes and adjustments
• Handling live disputes or issues
• Final approval on non-contracted services, including extended performance
• Coordinating with venue staff and event planners
• Making real-time operational decisions

• Band members defer to event handler for client-facing decisions during performances
• Internal concerns or suggestions should be communicated to event handler privately when possible





11. DECISION-MAKING AND COMMUNICATION
11.1 Booking and Scheduling
• All gig offers will be communicated to relevant members based on tier and availability
• Members confirm availability within 48 hours when possible

• Setlist development is collaborative with input from all performing members
• Song assignments respect vocalist strengths and preferences
• New material is introduced with sufficient rehearsal time

• Changes to this operational agreement require unanimous consent from all core members
• Founding vocalists (David and Shelley) have input on changes affecting vocalist structure
• All members are encouraged to raise concerns or suggestions openly





12. GROWTH PATHWAY
12.1 Progressive Development
As Ultraphonics secures more premium gigs ($1,000+ musician base), Kelsey's participation naturally increases, building toward consistent full-roster status while maintaining fair compensation for all members.

12.2 Tier Threshold Evolution
• Current threshold: $1,000 musician base distinguishes standard from premium gigs
• As the band consistently books higher-paying events, this threshold may be adjusted upward
• Goal: Maintain sustainable compensation while expanding full-roster opportunities

12.3 Future Considerations
• If the band consistently books premium gigs for 6+ months, the agreement may be revisited to adjust tier thresholds
• Additional musicians may be added using a similar progressive model
• Equipment investment reimbursement models may be implemented as revenue grows



13. AGREEMENT TERM AND MODIFICATIONS
13.1 Term
This agreement remains in effect indefinitely until modified or terminated by mutual consent.

13.2 Review Schedule
The band will review this operational structure every 6 months or after 10 performances, whichever comes first, to ensure it continues serving all members fairly.
